# Cave Level built in Unreal Engine 4

## Description

This Unreal Engine level was built over the course of a semester as an end-of-course project. The direction of the project was to design and build a level in Unreal Engine 4 that was both engaging and showed off proficiency with various of the tools found in UE4.

The level designed was named *Nec Evadere* which is Latin for “no escape.” The objective of the level is to find and collect at least 10 dynamite and destroy the bolder preventing escape. There is counter on the side of the screen to show how many have been collected. A message saying how many you still need to collect is also shown. When all the necessary dynamite is collected, a ‘cutscene’ plays that highlights where the exit is. When you reach the exit, there is A short pause of 5 seconds, then the bolder is destroyed. The escape tunnel is now open, and you hear a celebratory jingle marking your completion. 

The long, in-depth, technical and narrative breakdown can be found in the level-design-document, [HampshireMidtermPaper.pdf](/HampshireMidtermPaper.pdf) that was submitted more than 3/4ths of the way through the development of the level. The final rundown of the level and it's objective can be found in the final write-up, [HampshireFinalPaper.pdf](/HampshireFinalPaper.pdf).
